# Add a new locale

You MUST use ISO 15897 names for region-specific languages, e.g. `fr_FR` for
French from France and `es_ES` for Spanish from Spain.

You MUST follow these steps, in order:

1. You MUST register the locale in the `locales` array of
   `config/jacques.php`, with a `label` (the language in its own words), a
   `region` (the country in its own words), a `date_format` (the order that
   language reads dates in), a `number_format` (one of the `NumberFormatEnum`
   values) and a `flag` (a CSS `background` value drawn with gradients, never an
   image):
   ```php
   'nl_NL' => [
       'label' => 'Nederlands',
       'region' => 'Nederland',
       'date_format' => 'd-m-Y',
       'number_format' => 'dot_comma',
       'flag' => 'linear-gradient(to bottom, #ae1c28 0 33%, #fff 33% 66%, #21468b 66%)',
   ],
   ```
2. You MUST run `php artisan jacques:localize`. It creates
   `lang/{locale}.json` and reports how many strings the new locale is missing.
   You MUST NOT create or order that file by hand.
3. You MUST translate every key it reports as missing, adding it to
   `lang/{locale}.json`. Keep the `:placeholders` untouched, and match the
   plain, calm tone of `lang/en.json`.
4. You MUST run `php artisan jacques:localize` again and confirm the new
   locale reports nothing missing.
5. You MUST NOT touch the language pickers or the validation rules. They all
   read `config('jacques.locales')`, so a registered locale shows up on its
   own.
6. You MUST run `php artisan test` afterwards, since a test that counts the
   locales may need updating.
7. You MUST run `php artisan jacques:localize --check` to confirm the new
   locale is in sync with the code.

You MAY also declare how the new language punctuates, as a `typography` key in
the same `config/jacques.php` entry, and write its section in
[`.claude/rules/translations.md`](../../rules/translations.md). It is optional:
a locale that declares nothing is not checked, which is where eight of the nine
stand. French is written there in full and is the example to copy. Declare it
only if you read the language, since the check then refuses every value that
breaks it, including the ones already translated.
